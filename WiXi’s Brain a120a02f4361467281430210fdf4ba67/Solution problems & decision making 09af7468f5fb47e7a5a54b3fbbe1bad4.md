# Solution problems & decision making

- **Decision**
A choice that you make about something after thinking about it: the result of deciding.
- Decision Making
The thought process of selecting a logical choice from the available options.

### Three Key Elements In the Process

1. Know your purpose
2. Understand your biases
    - Legal considerations, ethical considerations, etc.
3. Consider different consequences

### Types of Problems

1. Problems for which the possible solutions are unknown
    - Problems where the cause is unknown and must be discovered
    - Problems where the cause is known, or is unknown and irrelevant
2. Problems for which the solutions are known, but the best solution is not obvious
    - Solutions with certain outcomes
    - Solutions with uncertain outcomes
    - Solutions in need of being prioritized

### Two General Categories of Problem Solving

- Analytical Problem Solving
    - Four Algorithmic Methods
        1. Root cause analysis
        2. Matrix decision analysis
        3. Decision tree
        4. Precedence chart

    Verical bar graph in which values are plotted in decreasing order of relative frequency from left to right.
    **What does show us?**
    - Issues that cause most of our problems
    - The most important things
    **Steps to do:
    1.**Determine the problem categories.
    **2.**Tabulate the data.
    **3.**Plot the chart.
    **4.**Understand and act on the results.

- **Histogram**
    
    Shows us information as it actually exists; Allows us to make decisions based on evaluation of available information.
